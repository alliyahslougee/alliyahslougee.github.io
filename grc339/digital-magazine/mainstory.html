                            <h2>The Best of 2021 (so far)</h2>
                    
                                <p>Let’s be honest: It’s been an unusual year in music so far. At the midway point of 2021, many of the heavyweights in rap and pop are still holding on to their albums, waiting for the full-blown return of live concerts and festivals. In their absence, up-and-comers like Pooh Shiesty and Olivia Rodrigo have stepped up and taken advantage of the lull to make noise of their own, previewing what music might sound like in years to come. If you miss the A-listers, though, you’re in luck. All signs point to the second half of the year bringing the kind of blockbuster albums that have largely evaded us so far. J. Cole’s The Off-Season may have just broken the seal, and now we await rumored releases from the likes of Drake and Kendrick (and even a joint project from Lil Baby and Lil Durk).</p>

                                <p>Because of all this, our annual mid-year best albums list arrives at a moment of transition, which makes it a great time to reflect on the projects that have defined 2021 up until now. These are the artists who were bold enough to release albums in a time of uncertainty, and whose fearlessness has already been rewarded. .</p>

                                </figure>

                                <p>After dominating 2020 with her #1 smash hit “Say So” and ushering in 2021 with the “34+35” remix and the resurgence of “Streets” thanks to the TikTok Silhouette Challenge, Doja Cat has officially launched the campaign for her next studio album. Titled Planet Her, the three-time Grammy nominee’s latest record is due sometime this year. For the first taste of the new album, Doja teamed up with SZA for the best pop song of 2021 so far: “Kiss Me More.”.</p>

                                <p>The greatest part of “Kiss Me More” is how seamlessly SZA fits on the track. It truly is beautiful to see two Black women who rose to prominence outside of mainstream pop so effortlessly dominate that space. Although SZA is practically incoherent for the majority of her verse, her mumbles combined with Doja’s slight vocal fry add different textures to the saccharine instrumental. As is common on SZA songs, she slides on the track like a rapper although she is singing the whole time. Her approach to “Kiss Me More” is reminiscent of the ways he acutely attacked the instrumental on “All The Stars.” She uses a smart combination of swagger and enjambment to make it all happen. The two stars’ voices fit well together, and their chemistry shines through on the track and in the excellent accompanying music video. Admittedly, “Kiss Me More” is a safe lead single. This doesn’t make the track any less great or any less enjoyable, but, knowing the vastness of Doja’s artistry, Planet Her is bound to sound a bit more left-field than this.</p>

                                <p>The “Law of Averages” in the Vince Staples universe is anything but compared to his peers out there, though the first single from the rap futuroso’s forthcoming self-titled album does warrant some reading into. From the hard and menacing days of Summertime ‘06 to the daring genre crossovers of Big Fish Theory, Staples’ creative trajectory has made for one of the more exciting unravelings in the game, and has been a lesson taught on how to master both substance-filled flow while bringing hip-hop into territories unknown. “Law of Averages” makes the most out of both.</p>

                                <p>TiaCorine crafted probably one of the catchiest tunes of 2020: the laconic SoundCloud hit ‘Lotto’, all stuttering percussion and deadpan delivery (“Scratch off like lotto / Bitch try ya luck”), became the North Carolina newcomer’s calling card. Now, on her feature-less debut EP, she blazes through with her signature Playboi Carti-style baby voice, which won fans in Rico Nasty and SZA. These eight tracks demand the question: can she prove that the TikTok-adored ‘Lotto’ was more than just a one-hit wonder?</p>

                                    Most of us have no say in the names we carry—they’re given to us at birth. In music, though, it’s a little different. Artists get to choose their stage names, which is one of the most important steps in establishing an identity.
