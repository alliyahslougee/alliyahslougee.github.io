                                <p>
                                    Let’s be honest: It’s been an unusual year in music so far. At the midway point of 2021, many of the heavyweights in rap and pop are still holding on to their albums, waiting for the full-blown return of live concerts and festivals. If you miss the A-listers, though, you’re in luck. All signs point to the second half of the year bringing the kind of blockbuster albums that have largely evaded us so far.

                                <p>
                                    It costs a lot of money to make your favorite collaborations—and we’re not just talking about studio and production expenses. Guest verses have become a very lucrative business in rap. Some artists trade verses amongst collaborators for free, but others have used features as an opportunity to cash out.

                                    There’s no denying that Friday is the best day of the week (it even has an entire song dedicated to it). It marks the end of your five day stretch as a corporate drone, opening up an entire weekend full of opportunities. A weekend getaway? Maybe. Prepping for the next episode of Game of Thrones? More Likely. However you choose to spend the weekend, you’re going to need some fresh songs to accompany everything from your Saturday night pregame to your Sunday morning hangover.

                                    Post Malone on Friday (July 9) will reportedly release a new song called "Motley Crew," a tune seemingly inspired by Motley Crue, the veteran hard rock band whose name the title adopts and alters.

                                <p>
                                    For the last few months, Olivia Rodrigo has been chiseling out a story about young love turned sour. Between the undulating ballad “Drivers License” — her huge debut single, which opened at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed there for eight weeks — and the wistfully aggrieved (and perhaps even better) “Deja Vu,” she’s nailed the agony of collapse, and the anxiety of watching your old partner rebuild.

                                Like many other artists currently, Ari Lennox is enjoying living her life more than making new music right now. The Dreamville songstress took to Twitter on Thursday afternoon to express how proud she is of her last album, Shea Butter Baby, and that she has put her heart and soul into every release up to his point.

                                Most of us have no say in the names we carry—they’re given to us at birth. In music, though, it’s a little different. Artists get to choose their stage names, which is one of the most important steps in establishing an identity.

                                Former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel resented the Chicago drill scene so much, he didn’t even want a hologram of Chief Keef to perform in the city, arguing that it “posed a significant safety risk.”

                            <p>
                                Directed by Leff, the visual follows 21 and Metro on their Wall Street grind right before the stock market implodes. The two appear to dodge a financial crisis through $DRCO stocks and bonds, which they promise will lead investors to financial freedom. The video features a infomercial parody for the business, and includes cameos by DJ Khaled, Shaq, Bow Wow, and more.
