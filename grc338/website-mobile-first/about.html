            <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
            <p>In addition to providing the community with a wide variety of organic coffees and teas, we work hard to maintain a sustainable model of consumption. Beyond simple recycling, we ensure our paper products are made from as much post-consumer recyclable material as available.</p>
            <p>Our “plastic” products are actually not plastic at all, but a plastic-like material made from corn. Traditional plastic products are made from oil. Not only are they a drain on precious natural resources, but they also take 200 years to biodegrade. Conversely, our corn-based plastics support American farmers, are less destructive to the environment, and biodegrade in only 45-60 days when exposed to the elements. </p>
            <P>We are excited that a significant portion of our company profits are donated to non-political charitable foundations worldwide that support our mission to promote education, health, and the environment. </P>
